            I think I'd like to look through it on my own.

{@player} Tío, this is O. Do you copy?  
{@kelpMechanic} Hola, mijita! ¿Qué pasa?
{@player} Tío, I just found out Mer was working on an upgrade for {nameof @guide}.
{@player} It could help to unscramble all those glitchy messages from Sam.
{@kelpMechanic} Hmm. I remember Mer talking about an upgrade.  
{@kelpMechanic} Not sure if she ever finished it. 
{@kelpMechanic} She called it something to do with a cephalopod... a nautilus, or maybe an orthoceras...?
{@player} An ammonite?
{@kelpMechanic} Oh, that was it! 
{@kelpMechanic} I'll see if I can find it. 
{@player} Gracias, Tío. Please hurry.

{@player}   Though I've never had so many weird ones in a row. 
{@guide}    Perhaps you could ask your mother--
{@player}   No. Don't tell her about this, {nameof @guide}.

        According to my sensors, you did not get optimal rest. 
{@player} Yeah. 
          I can't stop thinking about Mer. 
          And Sam.
{@guide}  Hmmm. When I'm in idle mode, I like to do quadratic reformulations of nonlinear binary optimization problems.
