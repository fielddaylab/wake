{@$JobGiverId}  Oh, Ollie...
                Got a call from {nameof kelpMechanic} at the {nameof RS-1C}. He wants to talk to you about upgrading an access card.
                You may want to visit him before taking any new jobs.
                That said, want to see the {h}Job Board{/h}?
$choice .action.openJobBoard; Sure!
$choice .action.cancel; No thanks.

#WrongStationJobHandler(a)
{@$JobGiverId}  Hmm, it looks like you've taken a job with someone else.
                Unfortunately I can't help you with it here.
                No shame in switching jobs to something here though.
                Still want to see the {h}Job Board{/h}?
    $choice .action.openJobBoard; Yes.
    $choice .action.cancel; Nah.

#WrongStationJobHandler(b)
{@$JobGiverId}  I think you have a job with someone else right now.
                You'll have to talk to them for the details.
                Could always take a job here though...
                Still want to see the {h}Job Board{/h}?
    $choice .action.openJobBoard; Yes.
    $choice .action.cancel; Nah.

#WrongCharacterJobHandler(a)
{@$JobGiverId}  Hmm... looks like your current job is with {nameof @profArctic}.
                You should talk to her about that. 

#JobHandler(a)
{@$JobGiverId}  {random Got|So, do you have} anything to report for your current job?
    $choice .action.report; Yep!
    $choice .action.openJobBoard; Let me {random see|look at} the {h}Job Board{/h}.
    $choice .action.cancel.currentJob; Nope.

{@$JobGiverId}  Okay. Let me know when you need me.

{@$JobGiverId}  Just let me know when you're ready.

    // STORY BEAT H
    {@player}   Oh, before I go... 
                I found an old note of Mer's. She was working on an upgrade for {nameof @guide}.
                 Do you know anything about that?
    {@arcticSci} Hmm... Meredith may have mentioned it once or twice, but beyond that, I'm not sure. 
                 She was always working on something new. 
                 Sorry I can't be more help, Ollie.
