{@$JobGiverId}  Hey Ollie!
                {nameof kelpMechanic} wants us to remind you to talk to him at the {nameof RS-1C}. Something about upgrading an access card?
                Consider giving him a visit before taking any new jobs.

{@$JobGiverId} Oh, hey Ollie. Nice to see you.
{@player} Thanks, {nameof @$JobGiverId}.
{@player} You doing okay? Seems like it gets kind of quiet out here...
{@$JobGiverId} Yes. Extremely. 
{@$JobGiverId} Nice, isn't it? 
{@$JobGiverId} I was just finishing up a game of chess with {nameof @arcticMechanic}. 
{@$JobGiverId} Poor guy... I'm sure he'll beat me one of these days.

{@$JobGiverId} Hey, Ollie! I was just chatting with your mom.
{@player} Wait... you know my mom? 
{@$JobGiverId} Sure. I've got colleagues all over. 
{@$JobGiverId} Is it true that you've got a friend on the Challenger Deep mission? 
{@player} Yeah. My best friend {nameof @sam}.
{@$JobGiverId} My friend {nameof @ex} is on that mission, too! She was out here a few months ago, studying snow algae.
{@$JobGiverId} She's amazing. Your friend {nameof @sam} is in good company.

{@$JobGiverId} Ollie! We heard what happened with the Challenger Deep. 
{@$JobGiverId} Thank goodness you were there!
{@player} Thanks, {nameof @profArctic}. 
{@player} I just wish I could've saved the probe, too. 
{@$JobGiverId} You had to make a tough decision, Ollie. 
{@$JobGiverId} And you got everyone out of there alive.
{@$JobGiverId} Even Mer couldn't have done better than that. 


#WrongStationJobHandler(a)
{@$JobGiverId}  Hmm, it looks like you've taken a job with someone else.
                Unfortunately I can't help you with it here.
                No shame in switching jobs to something here though.
                Still want to see the {h}Job Board{/h}?
    $choice .action.openJobBoard; Yes.
    $choice .action.cancel; Nah.

#WrongStationJobHandler(b)
{@$JobGiverId}  I think you have a job with someone else right now.
                You'll have to talk to them for the details.
                Could always take a job here though...
                Still want to see the {h}Job Board{/h}?
    $choice .action.openJobBoard; Yes.
    $choice .action.cancel; Nah.

#WrongCharacterJobHandler(a)
{@$JobGiverId}  Ah, hang on, your current job is with {nameof @arcticSci}.
                Why don't you talk to him?

{@$JobGiverId}  {random Hey, got|So, do you have} anything to report for your current job?

    // STORY BEAT H
    {@player}   Oh, by the way... 
                {nameof @profArctic}, my uncle said Mer was working on an upgrade for her comms system.
                 Do you know anything about that?
    {@arcticSci} Hmm... I do remember her working on some fixes. 
                  She was waiting to use it until she was sure it wouldn't damage her A.I. 
                  There was some kind of upgrade code. Mollusca? Nautili? 
                  No, that's not quite right... 
    {@player}   Please let me know if you remember, Professor. It's important. 
    {@arcticSci} Certainly, Ollie. I'll see what I can dig up.
