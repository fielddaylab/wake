{@guide}    Hmmmm.|.|.| we might need to hunt around for some new jobs.
            We could head back to the {map-name}Helm{/map-name} to explore new stations on our {h}Map{/h}.
            Or we could check the job board for upgrades we need, then upgrade our sub at the {map-name}Shop{/map-name}.
            Otherwise we could do some more exploring at the dive sites. |The choice is yours!

{@guide}        {nameof kelpMechanic} said you should go talk to him at the {nameof RS-1C} to upgrade your access card.
                But if you don't feel like doing that yet, we'll need to head to a research station and take a job!

                But if you don't feel like doing that yet, I'd recommend we see if there are any jobs available.

{@player}       {random Uh|Hey}, V1ctor? Any idea what I should be doing?
{@guide #confused}
        Oh, well, uh... I don't have anything specific.
        {#} But I'd look back at what the job-giver had to tell us.
        And maybe check your {item-name}AQOS Tablet{/item-name} too?
